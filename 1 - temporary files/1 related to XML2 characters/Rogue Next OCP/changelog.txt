Info:
-Missing 2 powers boost (Reflective Aura that is an Xtreme boost and Heal that debuff at the cost of 10% heath, Reflective Aura is too powerful?)
-Power Steal has been changed to Life Steal(power steal probably does not work in MUA)

Change:
-  name = power2 ;       victimeventtag2  fix (haven't' checked if working)
-   is_power = true ; added to powers
- added Heal boost
- Rogue's Tremor & Rogue's Energy Overflow effect fix(p5_power.xmlb) by Fr3ddy
 
 What remains?
-Passive check : checking what fits the best per skin
-Melee atk are from XML2 wrestling, she uses that, but feels very slow for a woman character
