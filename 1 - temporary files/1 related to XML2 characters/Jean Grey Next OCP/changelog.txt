Changes:
-added missing boost from XML2
-added missing Mental Guardian power
-proper chain time value for melee atk
- name = power8 ; fixed victimeventtag2 (haven't checked if working lol)
- is_power = true ; added to powers
- Mental Guardian offset position fix by Fr3ddy
- adding pain_blocking to her animset, was missing previously causing the common_pain blocking playing instead of the Invisible Woman anim
- Better timing for grab fix by Fr3ddy.

What remains?
-Mental Guardian talent value check (maybe value too high)
-Passive check : checking what fits the best per skin

Freddy blocking effet report:
Jean Grey
-blocking effect
 Currently i think she is using effect from MUA2 ps2 version, which is a bad one, wrong color and wrong position too.
 I cannot decide if she should use her effect from xml1's TK shield or completely newly modified from Invis Woman by myself here, 
 which in correct colour/position and looks matched to her TK power effects. Both looks better than that MUA2 ps2.
