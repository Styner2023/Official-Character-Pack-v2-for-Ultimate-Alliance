Maegawa booster used as based, but tweaked
https://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php/topic,9124.msg182734.html#msg182734


Changelog after installing Maegawa's booster:
-cleaned up Maegawa herostat to match latest OCP herostat
-Maegawa uses a technique to have the same passive for all skins, reverted this change with the old XML2 conversion
-Maegawa uses 2 uniques talent, one for resist and one for radiation resist, reverted this with the old XML2 conversion (only fire resist via "sunfire_resist)
-herostat renamed Classic skin to Original, because Bacon did this in his thread
-herostat renamed Modern skin to 90s, because Bacon did this in his thread
-   is_power = true ; added to powers (already done by Maegawa)
- Added light1, 2, 3, popup from XML2 fightstyle_hero
- Now use Human Torch knockback attack, fits better imo (was default in OCP, but Maegawa changed this)
-moved flying stateffect to powerstyle

What remains?
-Maegawa modified some effect file, maybe causing incompability with other mod?
-Passive check : checking what fits the best per skin
-radiation immunity?
