Description:

Ever since I first installed Sunfire's mod, I've always complained about
how his skill list was drastically reduced in comparison to his XML2
counterpart. I once stumbled across 12emre12's Sunfire booster that
added his missing skills from XML2, but the download link wasn't
working. Back then, my modding skills were rather limited, so there was
nothing I could do about it. Recently, while playing XML2, I remembered
about my issue with Sunfire, and decided to make this booster. Though
the main goal of it is giving Sunfire his missing skills from XML2,
there are other features I've added, which may or may not be listed...

========================================================================

Changes in v1.1:

1. Minor tweaks to the herostat, powerstyle and talent files.
-> There were some skills that built up the momentum bar and didn't make
   combos, that's because I had forgotten to add the is_power = true
   line to each entry, fixed now.

========================================================================

Notes for v1.0:

1. The passives are only manageable through the 1st skin slot, but they
   affect every skin. The 2nd passive is unlocked from the start (just
   like the 1st skill).

2. This mod replaces files and requires you to edit one or more files,
   remember to backup any file you are replacing/editing, as I am NOT
   responsible for the loss of any file.

3. This mod requires the original Sunfire mod to be installed first.

========================================================================

Features:

- All of Sunfire's skills from XML2. (with the exception of his 2nd
  Xtreme, 10 powers in total)
- Improvements to some powers.
- Mannequin effect. (see the [Mannequin Effect] folder for info)
- Minor changes to a few effects.
- New ability: Radiation Immunity.
- New Age of Apocalypse skin effect.
- New herostat.
- New knockback move.
- Sound and new effect for grab smash.
- XML2 style passives. (see note #1 for info)

========================================================================

Skills:

1. Ignite: Bursts nearby enemies into flames.
-> Now ignites enemies, just like Ghost Rider's Ravaging Flame. (power's
   name was Ignite but it didn't ignite enemies, WTF?)
-> The flaming hand effect was too rushed, so I delayed it a little.

2. Flamethrower: Shoots flames from hands in a wide arc.
-> New skill.
-> The damage of each hit was 0, now causes what is said in the talent.
-> The XML2 effect didn't work on MUA, and I wasn't able to fix it
   either, so I took Human Torch's effect and edited it in order to
   match the rest of Sunfire's effects.

3. Atomic Charge: A radiated homing projectile.
-> Used to cause 1 damage on impact, now causes what is said in the
   talent.

4. Fiery Geyser: Creates a column of flame that harms nearby enemies.
-> New skill.
-> Added screen shake effect.

5. Blazing Barrage: Launches fireballs at targets.

6. Flame Sword: Sweeping arc of fire that can hit multiple enemies.
   Increased critical chance.

7. Inferno: Launches a fireball that explodes on contact and harms
   nearby enemies for a time.
-> New skill.

8. Flaming Fury: Adds $DMG_FIRE to melee attacks for self and allies.
-> New skill.
-> Added screen shake effect.
-> It didn't actually add $DMG_FIRE to melee attacks, fixed it.
-> Since the ATK trait doesn't exist in MUA, I removed that part of the
   power.

9. Ion Shield: Forms a shield of atomic particles that increases defense
   and damages enemies.
-> In XML2, it increases the DEF trait based on a percentage of the
   hero's current DEF. However, in MUA, it works different, as the
   hero's DEF trait is always 0, with the only way of increasing it
   being throught the costume passives. So instead of increasing a
   percentage of the trait, I made it add points to it.

10.Super Nova: Mushroom cloud that causes $DMG_FIRE and $DMG_RADIATION.
-> Both damages were triggered at the same time, causing only one of
   them to actually hit the enemies, so I added index = 1 and index = 2
   in order to make both of them hit the enemies. I also added harming
   $DMG_RADIATION (just like the one from Atomic Charge) and massive
   knockback (gosh, it is a freaking nuclear explosion!).

========================================================================

Passives:

1. Fire Mastery: Increases damage and chance for criticals with
   $DMG_FIRE.

2. Elemental Combat: Adds additional $DMG_FIRE to melee attacks.

3. Ionize: Increases all resistances.

4. Mutant Master: Increases $EP regeneration rate.

========================================================================

Bugs:

1. Some skills, when used while flying, allow free movement while they
   are performed. I'm not sure whether this can be fixed or not, seeing
   as it is probably an animation issue.

========================================================================

To install this booster, follow these steps:

1. Move the folders (actors, data... ui) from the original Sunfire mod
   to your MUA directory;

2. Move the folders (actors, data... textures) from this booster to your
   MUA directory;

3. Decompile herostat.engb (located in the data folder of your MUA
   directory) using the XMLBCUI program;

4. Choose a character you want to replace (I recommend Ghost Rider or
   Human Torch, as the mannequin effect is only compatible with their
   spots) and replace his/her herostat entry with the one present in the
   Herostat.txt file from this booster;

5. Change the XX from the menulocation line with the one from the
   character you just replaced;

6. Save and compile it back;

7. Place the new herostat.engb in the data folder your MUA directory;

8. Start a new game using default statistics;

9. Enjoy your new mod!
