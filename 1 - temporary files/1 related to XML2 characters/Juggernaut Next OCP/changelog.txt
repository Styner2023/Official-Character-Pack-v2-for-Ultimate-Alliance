Info:
-missing "Widowmaker power" (it's a stronger thunderous punch with same animation, but stunning in the end Juggernaut) and Path of Destruction (very strong Xtreme boost)
Not sure if adding those powers are worthwhile, either way if it's decided to not add them, need to remove their fightmove in powerstyle if present for optimization.

-Cannot use his XML1 animations, because he's using an unique skeleton too different (bigger) from the common one

Changes:
-added light1, 2 and 3, popup  from XML2 fightstyle_wrestling since Juggernaut uses that in this game+Power8 Crime Rage is supposed to use those wrestling animations
-   is_power = true ; added to powers
-Icons from texture file:changed Cyttorak's Folly icon to Widowmaker, since Widowmaker icons was not present and Path of Destruction unused
-Path of Destruction not added, it's an Xtreme in MUA, too strong as normal boost, still can be added with tweak
-Crimson rage power fix by ak2yny
- Juggy's Arcane Fist - p2_impact file & also crack(decal) not in the right position, should be origin = 20 8 0 20 8 0 ; fix by Fr3ddy

What remains?
-Passive check : checking which passive and icon fit the best per skin
