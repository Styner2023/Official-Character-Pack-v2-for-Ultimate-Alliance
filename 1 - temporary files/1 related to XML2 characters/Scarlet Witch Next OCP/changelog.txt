10Xtreme Anarchy Assault

Changes made:
-Added missing powers
-fixed popup attribute that shrink ennemies (victimeventtag2 fix as reported by Fr3ddy)
-new flying & blocking effect from Fr3ddy
-passive:
dodge icon removed (now use vanilla icon)
Witch's Touch changed to "Scarlet's Touch" with Critical Strike attribute now like in XML2
-Crate texture upscale with ersgan (thx MrK for sharing this), her power is a copy paste from Dr. Strange, which is itself based on Scarlet's power
-   is_power = true ; added to powers
-change passive icon of "Probable Life" to common resurect ally icons, previously was using revitalize icon, which is fine, but I needed to replace an icon for a missing power 
-use her XML2 special_trail files, the one from MUA is different, because it adds trail effect, while in XML2 there is no such effects
-POSITIONING NOT PERFECT Locked Hex (power4) actually got victim effect on the head (disc-like) horizontally, instead of vertically, report by Fr3ddy, fixed by editeing trail_elem+misc text origin value from p3_impact.xmlb
-       sound = char/switch_v/laugh ; code, changed time to 0 so it always plays, otherwise the laught does not play or very rarely as reported by Fr3ddy

What remains?
- Passive check : checking what fits the best per skin
- talent value check
- removal of unique trail talent if possible from the herostat
- adjust Crate power damage value to be more similar to Strange
