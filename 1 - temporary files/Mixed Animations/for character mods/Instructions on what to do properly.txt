Just drag the actor folder (data folders if applicable), as well as the herostat text files (also if applicable) into the contents of the old mods you want to play with, clicking Yes to everything being replaced. 

These mods used a now very outdated 'fightstyle' animation set approach originally that required two seperate animation files for most gameplay animations (a 4_combat file and a fightstyle animation file). 
This was found to be much more demanding on Marvel Ultimate Alliance for the worst in the long run, leading often to severe gameplay glitches or increased instability as a result of technical limits being breached, leading often to game crashes with specific loadouts that required a restart of one's computer or outright avoidance of certain teams altogether at worst.
Since the recent creation of a newer animation mixing approach by many members of the MarvelMods community that required only one animation file for combat and power animations, more and more newer character mod releases have moved away from the old method (as its been discovered that the game is much more stable and less glitchy when playing full teams of four with characters created or converted over to the newer animation method).
Over time, I learned to familiarise myself with this new animation mixing approach for my own works and realized the limitless creative possibilities opened up via this method as well, one's imagination no longer being held back by frustrating technical constraints.
With this revelation, I realized how beneficial this massive undertaking of a project would be for older character mod releases as well and set to work, in order to bring everything up to a newer quality standard (sending the updated files to active modders while hosting the files for mods you've downloaded by inactive creators for convenience).
All that said, I hope this improves the various large rosters many players can create nowadays and make the overall experience much more enjoyable long into the future.
Have fun!
