Changelog by ak2yny
-------------------

v3:
- Erik Lensherr\Ermac (Mortal Kombat)
   Completely new mix, using correct priority this time: low - fightstyle; mid - normal set (except in non-combat); high - 4_combat set
- Erik Lensherr\Shocker (Marvel Comics)
   Mixed in a number of animations from Cap's fightstyle_default.
   Note: this is an NPC made playable mod using only the NPC animations, without menu animations. It heavily relied on that fs default.
- Erik Lensherr\Surtur (Marvel Comics)
   Added code from the org. fightstyle of the mod to the powerstlye, because it differs from fightstyle_default. (It's now heavy on triggers again - 307, fighmoves - 49)
   Note: The mod is missing animations power_8_end, and power_8_loop
- Blaw\Bane (DC Comics)
   Added packages where fightstyle animation set reference is removed.
- Blaw\Batman
   Added packages where fightstyle animation set reference is removed.
- Blaw\Harley Quinn (DC Comics)
   Added packages where fightstyle animation set reference is removed.
   Used and still uses fightstyle_default.
- Blaw\The Joker (DC Comics)
   Added blocking fightmove to the powerstyle, it's different from fightstyle_default, and the only move that wasn't in the ps before
   added remaining animations to 28_joker_4_combat, they were forgotten for some reason
   Added packages where fightstyle animation set reference is removed.
- Blaw\Nightwing (DC Comics)
   Added Cap's lunge_land to 62_nwing_4_combat, which was used with OCP 1.3 and has better transition to Nightwing's idle
   Added packages where fightstyle animation set reference is removed.
- Blaw\Superman
   Added packages where fightstyle animation set reference is removed.
- Blaw\Ultimate Green Goblin
   Mixed with original animation sets, re-constructing the changes (hex-editing), and respecting the priorities, while checking the actual animations of the unmodified mod in the game. The animation set of the fightstyle is using fightstyle_thing, as can be seen when decompiling the xmlb file. The fightstyle animation set included (using Colossus' 4_combat animation set) is never used.
- Blaw\War Machine - The Patriot
   New fix: mixed animations to remove his fightstyle
   added three fightmoves from the removed fightstyle to his powerstyle
   updated herostat
- Dorpond\Brainiac (DC Comics)
   Fixed ce_spawn_actor using the correct character (Brainiac). No need for shared_nodes_combat anymore, this file can now safely be replaced by the OCP2 version.
   Removed skin and skin filter, since using himself as a character for spawning automatically uses the current skin.
- Aventureiromax\Android 18 (Dragon Ball)
   Removed fightstyle_and18 from packages.
- Aventureiromax\Pink Ranger (Power Rangers)
   Removed fightstyle_pinkr from packages.
- Aventureiromax\Samus Aran
   Mixed with Captain America's animations, as with OCP, his animations are used, which also took care of the missing power animations. For these powers, I only added the missing ones from Cap.
   Removed fightstyle_aran from packages.
- Aventureiromax\The Terminator
   Removed fightstyle_t800 from packages.
- Boreman\CannonballV2
   Uses fightstyle_default (even before). Mixed animations from 157_luke_cage, 07_rogue (XML2) and fightstyle_default (07_captamerica_4_combat).
- Deedoo\Speed
   Added power_8 from Cap's fightstyle_default.
   Note: 147_spd.igb had two power_2. I used the first one, assuming that that's what the game does.
- Deedoo\Wiccan
   Added power_8 from Cap's fightstyle_default.
   Note: originally used 145_wic only, but mixed it to use it plus the 4_combat animation file. Two animations don't exist in MUA's shared_anims, but I added them again, just in case.
- Dihan\Elixir
   added code from the org. fightstyle of the mod to the powerstlye, because it differs from fightstyle_default. (jumpsmash & jumpsmash_release_impact)

- thetommyboy2002\The Flash
   Added first package where fightstyle animation set reference is removed.
- Tien\Green Lantern
   Added packages where fightstyle animation set reference is removed.
- ZuluViking\Ben 10
   This mod is already animation mixed, but it used the custom fightstyle for fallback purposes (which I don't know if it even works). Now, the fightstyle is removed from references, and fightmoves are in powerstyle only. Converted fallbacks to proper ones (except the second walk and run fallbacks but that doesn't seem to make any difference).
   Also changed a few requirements for moves (esp. stinkfly moves), so that it uses custom names instead. Minimized double remove triggers for powers that chain to default idle (which I renamed to ben_idle, because of fallback optimization) where the remaining remove triggers are.
   Note: Not tested.
   This mod could use a lot of improvements, such as inherit (idles, powers) and events, effect combining, move optimization for a few forms (I believe it's possible to have more than 2 or 3 affecters active, using levels), etc.
- Unknown\Crystal (Crystal_2 beta mod)
   Uses fightstyle_default (even before). Mixed animations from 04_storm_4_combat and fightstyle_default (07_captamerica_4_combat).

 boosters (remove this line)

   Removed block requirement from powerstyle.
- Cates\Mr Fantastic
   Removed block requirement from powerstyle.

- Gevth\Doom
   Fixed ce_spawn_actor using the correct character (DoomDLC). No need for shared_nodes_combat anymore, this file can now safely be replaced by the OCP2 version.
   Notes: The snc had ea_blocking for the end move, but ea_power2 looks much better and was most likely the intended animation. Also note that there would be a Doombot NPC, but NPCs must be loaded through the map in order to make this work. At least I don't know of another way.
   Fixed one of the powerusage triggers. It now uses twice as much power.
- Jeanfan321\Invisible Woman
   Removed block requirement from powerstyle.

   Note: ea_ground_attack1 is not in shared_anims. Using the default fighmove here (only the animation is different).
- Lean\Vertigo
   Fixed ce_spawn_actor using the correct character (Vertigo). No need for shared_nodes_combat anymore, this file can now safely be replaced by the OCP2 version.
   Removed skin and skin filter, since using herself as a character for spawning automatically uses the current skin.

   Removed block requirement from powerstyle.
   Fixed ce_spawn_actor using the correct character (Elektra). No need for shared_nodes_combat anymore, this file can now safely be replaced by the OCP2 version.
   Note: Added a second powerstyle, because a second move was left in the original booster's ps code, which differs as follows: ninja_start has 120 in ps maxrange instead of 70; ninja_end has ea_power1_end in ps animenum instead of ea_attack_trip1, 1.0 in ps playspeed instead of 0.6, 0 in ps damage instead of `18 64`, no damageMod in ps instead of trip.

v2:
- Jeanfan321\Aqua
   removed, the animations stay identical (all animation sets of this mod are duplicates of "22_invisiblewoman_4_combat.igb").
- Erik Lensherr\Doomsday (DC Comics)
   added code from the org. fightstyle of the mod to the powerstlye, because it differs from fightstyle_default. (attackknockback2)
- thetommyboy2002\The Flash
   added code from the org. fightstyle of the mod to the powerstlye, because it differs from fightstyle_default.
   also in PS: changed the animation for groundattackknockback2 to the default ea_attack_ground1, because ea_power14 does not exist.
- Tien\Green Lantern
   removed the grabfallback move from the new powerstyle. This is a leftover move, and it's also identical to the same move in fightstyle_default. Also, removed jumpsmash, attackstun_finish, attacktrip2, attack_knockback_charge, groundattack, which are identical to the same moves in fightstyle_default.
- Aventureiromax\He-Man (Masters of the Universe)
   added code from the org. fightstyle of the mod to the powerstlye, because it differs from fightstyle_default. (attackknockback2)
- Julio Cabral\Kung Lao (Mortal Kombat)

- Aventureiromax\Lion-O (Thundercats)

- LucasFernandesBR\Morrigan (Darkstalkers)
   added code from the org. fightstyle of the mod to the powerstlye, because it differs from fightstyle_default. (jumpsmash)
- Julio Cabral\MUA- Dragon Ball mods Pack1\Piccolo
   added code from the org. fightstyle of the mod to the powerstlye, because it differs from fightstyle_default. (attacklight, attackknockback2)
- thetommyboy2002\Red Tornado
   Removed menu animations from 10_redt_4_combat. Added power_1_loop from fightstyle_default.
   Changed herostat for better compatibility with OHS.
   This mod has serious animation issues. It seems like none of the fightstyle animations (fightstyle_redt, fightstyle_default) initially worked. Only power_2 is actually used, but there are two others: power_1_loop only to be found in fightstyle_default, power_4_loop is missing entirely. For the power_2, we assume that the one from fightstyle_redt was intended. This is only a guess, as everything looks bad. Since this never worked, it remains to assume that the creator never had a chance to truly choose a fitting animation.

   added code from the org. fightstyle of the mod to the powerstlye, because it differs from fightstyle_default. (attackknockback2)
