Changelog by ak2yny
-------------------

v2:
- Jeanfan321\Aqua
   removed, the animations stay identical (all animation sets of this mod are duplicates of "22_invisiblewoman_4_combat.igb").

   added code from the org. fightstyle of the mod to the powerstlye, because it differs from fightstyle_default.
   also in PS: changed the animation for groundattackknockback2 to the default ea_attack_ground1, because ea_power14 does not exist.
- Tien\Green Lantern
   removed the grabfallback move from the new powerstyle. This is a leftover move, and it's also identical to the same move in fightstyle_default. Also, removed jumpsmash, attackstun_finish, attacktrip2, attack_knockback_charge, groundattack, which are identical to the same moves in fightstyle_default.

- thetommyboy2002\Red Tornado
   Removed menu animations from 10_redt_4_combat. Added power_1_loop from fightstyle_default.
   Changed herostat for better compatibility with OHS.
   This mod has serious animation issues. It seems like none of the fightstyle animations (fightstyle_redt, fightstyle_default) initially worked. Only power_2 is actually used, but there are two others: power_1_loop only to be found in fightstyle_default, power_4_loop is missing entirely. For the power_2, we assume that the one from fightstyle_redt was intended. This is only a guess, as everything looks bad. Since this never worked, it remains to assume that the creator never had a chance to truly choose a fitting animation.
