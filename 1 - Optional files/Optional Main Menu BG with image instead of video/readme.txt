This change the main menu video background to a simple static texture background.

Recommendation, I recommend installing the Remaster interface, not necessary but best to remove the big gray border :

Default folder have loadscreen with the intended texture resolution size of 1024x576
1920x1080 is higher texture size, but maybe have negative effect (more memory used maybe I dunno, if not sure use the original intended size version).

How to install alternate background :
The texture of the main menu is located in your game folder textures\loading\main_menu.igb, choose your desired background and put it replace the main_menu.igb with the new one

Also note that you can use loadscreen file as main_menu.igb
