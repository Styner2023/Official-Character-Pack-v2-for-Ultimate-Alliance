Only required for boosters (and mods) that don't have their own herostat. OCP2 herostats don't have the block talent anymore, causing blocking issues with boosters that use these herostats, but have their own blocking fightmove which require the talent.

Install these only for the booster they are for, and only if the character has blocking issues.

If any other mod or booster has blocking issues, get the common file from here: https://github.com/ak2yny/Official-Character-Pack-v2-for-Ultimate-Alliance/blob/8f5422979ecc74e203a7589ba1a2007f59a77e3c/data/shared_nodes_combat.engb
Goes into the data folder.
