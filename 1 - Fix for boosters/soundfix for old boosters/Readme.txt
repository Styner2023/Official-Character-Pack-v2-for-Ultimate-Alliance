The OCP2 changed a few sound of official characters. They're now closer to the original DLC, and less like XML2. This causes issues with some boosters, which rely on the OCP 1.3 sound files.

Install these completely, or individually (if you're experienced), as you require them. If you have issues, also consider looking for newer mods and boosters for the character.

P.S.: You are welcome to update the boosters, so that they work with the newest OCP.
